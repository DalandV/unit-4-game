# unit-4-game

Welcome to Crystals Collector

This game was built as a way to practice my jQuery and javascript skills. Each crystal is assigned a random number at the start of each round. To play all you have to do is click on the crystals to try and get a number that matches the random number generated at the start of each game.  If you can get them to macth you win that round, but if your number goes over the random number you lose that round.

Give it a try and see if you can win!
